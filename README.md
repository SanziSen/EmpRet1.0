# EmpRet1.0
EmpRet1.0 is a Machine Learning model which helps to predict whether a particular employee is satisfied with his job and thus whether will continue to work in the firm or leave it.
The Model uses the concepts of Logistc Regression to decide whether a particular employee will leave the job or wll continue to work there, for which many previously captured data (present in HR_comma_sep.csv) are fit into the model to train it and then it is used to predict for further different data items.

## Files Provided ##
     1-code.py : Python source code
     2-code.ipynb : Jupyter Python Notebook
     3-HR_comm_sep.csv : A CSV file containing the data of the employees
     
## Processes incorporated : ##
     Using the Employee Retention dataset named HR_comma_sep.csv we : 
        1- Figured out which variables have direct and clear impact on employee retention (i.e. whether they leave the company or continue to work).
        2- Plotted bar charts showing impact of employee salaries on retention.
        3- Plotted bar charts showing correlation between department and employee retention.
        4- Built a logistic regression model using variables that were narrowed down in step 1.
        5- Measured the accuracy of the model.
